<h2> Description</h2>

<p>Rice is a versatile grain that is a staple food for more 
    than half of the world's population.
     It is cultivated in warm climates and comes in a variety of types, 
     including long-grain, medium-grain, and short-grain. 
     The most common varieties are white rice and brown rice, 
     with brown rice being a whole grain that retains its outer bran layer, making it more nutritious. Rice can be steamed, boiled, or fried and is used in a wide range of dishes, from Asian stir-fries to Italian risottos. It is a key source of carbohydrates, providing energy, and is often served as a side dish or as a base for main dishes..</p>
